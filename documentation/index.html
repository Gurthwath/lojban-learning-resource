		<h4>Purpose:</h4>
		<p>The purpose of this website is to give people learning Lojban easy access to simple tools for learning the vocabulary.  It should be understood that this site was created with the intent that it be used by individuals who are already familiar with Lojban, and have a solid grasp of Lojban grammar.  Without such prior knowledge, no fluency could be hoped to be gained from use of this website.</p>
		<h4>Goals:</h4>
		<p>The goals of this website are to provide several tools to aid Lojban speakers who wish to expand their vocabulary to learn and internalize sets of words.  The types of tools provided are flashcards, a matching game, and a guessing game.  If the user can consistently get perfect scores on the games over an extended period of time, they will internalize the new vocabulary.</p>
