		<p>Lojban is a constructed language.  This means that it is no different from any other language, except that it was designed specifically and intentionally.</p>
		<p>Lojban was made with logic and cross-nationality in mind.  A Lojban sentence's grammar is unambiguous.</p>
		<p>At the same time, a word or phrase can be of ambiguous meaning, and relative to the context of the situation</p>
		<p>Lojban is not 'the perfect language', and has little practical use, but it is fun to learn and use.</p>
		<p>This website was not made to teach Lojban.  If you want to start learning, <a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban">Lojban.org</a> is a great resource.</p>
